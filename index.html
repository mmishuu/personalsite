      <p class="bio">I am a Geopolitics and Socio-cultural Interference in South-Eastern Europe masters student. I ❤ technology, programming, video-games and making music.</p>

      <h2>My Hobbies.</h2>
      <p>It's not much, but it's honest work.</p>

        <h3>I'm pretty good at playing video games.</h3>
        <p>I enjoy playing any type of video game, and being honest, I'm pretty good at them. My favorite video game right now would probably be Rainbow Six Siege, even if I rarely play it. :) :)</p>

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I can't say that I'm in any way a professional or actually "skilled" photographer, it's more like a hobby to me. I don't take photographs on daily basis, but when I see something that I consider to be "phorographable" (I don't know if this
          word event exists), I take a quick shot of it. The end result always pleases me so I guess that's a hobby.</p>

        <h3>I recently started taking programming courses.</h3>
        <p>Since the 2nd grade when I got my first computer, I knew that I wanted to be able to use it to my advantage. I instantly fell in love with technology and all the aspects of it, so once I found out about this thing called "programming" I
          knew that it was something that I needed to learn in order to achieve my dream of being able to make a living out of spending most of my time on a computer. So here I am trying my best to learn as much as possible.</p>

        <h3>Video/Audio Editing</h3>
        <p>It started out as a joke when I was younger. I used to have lots of youtube channels of my own and I would post videos of me and my friends playing games like Minecraft, Battlefield or even Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. (I even held a livestream when I was 13 and I had at some point 123 people watching) I might have given
          up on my youtube career dream, but I still have the necessary skills to edit video and audio content.</p>
